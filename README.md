# Analysis_on_Electric_Vehicels using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Electric Vehicles (EVs) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from various attributes like vehicle type, model, range, charging capacity, and more.

## 📁 Project Overview

The increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide raises important questions about their performance, availability, and adoption trends. This analysis aims to:

- Understand the current landscape of EVs in the market.
- Analyze vehicle specifications such as battery range, charging time, and drivetrain type.
- Visualize trends using interactive plots.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used contains information on electric vehicles including:

- Make & Model
- Range (km)
- Battery Capacity (kWh)
- Charging Power
- Acceleration
- Top Speed
- Drivetrain Type
- Efficiency

> *Note: The dataset was pre-cleaned and loaded into a Jupyter Notebook for analysis.*

## 🧪 Analysis Highlights

- Distribution of EVs based on battery range and efficiency.
- Trends in acceleration vs top speed.
- Drivetrain analysis (FWD vs AWD vs RWD).
- Year-wise trend of EV model releases.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook


## 📈 Sample Visuals

- Correlation heatmaps
- Bar plots for drivetrain distribution
- Scatter plots for acceleration vs range
